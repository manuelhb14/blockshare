# Blockshare

[*Project for Evmos Momentum Hackathon*](https://evmos2022.devpost.com/)

Blockshare is a Web3 based DeFi application that lets you manage shared expenses in a decentralized way.

## How Blockshare works 

Blockshare is a [**Web3 application**](https://blockshare.app) built on the [**Evmos ecosystem**](https://evmos.org/). It is conformed by two parties, the creditor and the debtor(s). In order to get startd, the creditor connects its wallet and creates an expense which includes:
* Title
* Description
* Category
* Total to pay
* Deadline
* Required token
It then selects the debtors addressesâ€™ and the amount that each one will pay. Debtors then access the received expense and are able to pay the debt, be it by parts or all the debt in one transaction.

Supported ecosystems:

At the moment Blockshare is only available to be used with Evmos ecosystem. More information can be read on the [**documentation**](https://docs.evmos.org).
